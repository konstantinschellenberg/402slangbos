Import needed libraries
```{r}
library(raster)
```

Read vector data.
The ``system.file`` only required for R package data which is included in the demo.

```{r}
filename <- system.file("external/lux.shp", package="raster")
filename

# read
shape = shapefile(filename)

write
outfile = "out.shp"
shapefile(shape, outfile, overwrite = TRUE)

# both with the same function

```

At last we are also going to plot the vector graphic.

```{r}
plot(shape)
```
